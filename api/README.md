# Jamister Tabs (back-end)

## Technologies

- Graphql
- Prisma
- Apollo Server
- Nexus
- Express


## Local Development

Our back-end uses [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) because we have a VPS hosting at the moment.

Installing with `npm` is required to ensure dependencies match the current [package-lock.json](./package-lock.json).

```bash
$ npm install
```

Two .env files are needed, one in the root and one in the prisma folder. Both have example files.

After setting up the environment files, just start the server.

```bash
$ npm start
```
