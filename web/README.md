## Local Development

Our front-end uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for development.

Installing with `yarn` is required to ensure dependencies match the current [yarn.lock](./yarn.lock).

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Remember to create an `.env` file, there is an example file [here](./.env.example).

After setting up the environment file, just start the project.

```bash
$ yarn start
```
